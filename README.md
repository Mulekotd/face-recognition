# Face Recognition

## üìå Overview

A face recognition system built using Python and popular computer vision libraries. This project uses machine learning models to detect and recognize human faces in real-time through webcam input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Selected Technologies

### 1. Python 3.13.3

Used as the main programming language to implement the recognition logic and threading for performance.

### 2. NumPy

Used for efficient numerical computations, especially for handling face embeddings and calculating distances between vectors.

### 3. OpenCV

Used for image and video capture, as well as for rendering bounding boxes and text overlays on detected faces.
